Hey, welcome to the beta version of LeafDrop.
The controls and whatnot can be found easily within the game itself 
in the help menu.  
This is a fighting game, modeled mostly off the original street fighter II.
It was created almost entirely by me, over the course of a like two or three
months.  I don't remember exactly when I started.  A friend passing through
drew like maybe 30% of one of the frames of Leaf's animation.  Other than that,
all assets were created by me, except the font, which is an open source one.

It was a great deal of fun creating this game, and I hope I can continue to 
expand upon it, and now that I have the base game finished I am happy to 
accept collaboration if anyone is interested.  Any feedback or suggestions
about the direction of the game are welcome.  Below is my current ideas of 
improvements and additions to the game.  

Things to add:
--A Human vs AI mode so it can be played by one player.
--Actual balance for the game.  As I live alone, I couldn't really fight myself,
so while I tried to think of how to make each part balanced, I may very well
have created a pretty broken game.  Any feedback from testing on this would 
be welcome.  
--Additional Maps and Music
--Additional Characters
--(Far Off) Networked Multiplayer

Anyways, if this brings any amount of enjoyment to any number of people I'll be pretty happy.
Again, any comments, suggestions, critiscisms, etc, I am happy to recieve.  Have fun!
