LeafDrop is a fighting game 
in the tradition of Street Fighter 
and Guilty Gear.  It uses similar 
mechanics to those games while
adding something of its own 
flare as well.



1/14
##
The basic goal is to defeat 
the opponent by reducing their 
healthto zero before they do 
the same to you.  You do so by 
using two kinds of attacks in 
three different positions.  You 
also have access to a few special 
attacks, depending upon your 
character.
2/14
##
The two types of attacks are 
"strike"and "kick".  Strike 
attacks are more powerful, 
but slower.  Kicks are faster
but have shorter range and 
leave you vulnerable to a 
counterattack in a way
that strikes do not.

3/14
##
You can kick or strike while 
standing,crouching, or jumping.  
The three stances have something 
of a rock, paper, scizzors 
relationship due to the rules 
of blocking.



4/14
##
A character may block by holding 
the direction button away from 
the foe. Attacks striking a 
blocking foe will deal no damage 
and will leave the attacker 
vulnerable for a counterattack.
Each type of block has a specific 
weakness however, a type of attack 
that can harm through the block.
5/14
##
For crouching, the weakness is 
jumpingattacks.  For standing, 
the weakness is crouching attacks.  
Jumping characters cannot block, 
but they are also out of range 
of most crouching attacks.

Characters and Special Attacks
------------------------------
Each character will have special
attacks and mechanics in addition
to this basic interplay.  Special
attacks are typically performed 
by entering specific key combos.

sword and reletively short range
kicks.  He also uses leaves as 
ammunition to launch ranged and
gap closing attacks.  


9/14

He starts with three leaves in 
a fight, and can potentially go 
up to five.  Each use of a 
special consumes a leaf, while
they can be restored by catching
enemy leaves, taking damage, or
engaging in a peaceful reflection
upon nature.
